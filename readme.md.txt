Hello this is my more visual and interactive version of my text based game of the same name.
Important things to note
This runs on MS Visual Studio best
DungeonsAndAlligators.cs
In lines 42-45,78 and 80 you must edit the file paths that lead to these png files in your local env or 
the program breaks at compile time
Any questions please email me at thegreyabove@gmail.com
